# tensorforce-client
A local command line client to run reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments in the google cloud using the TensorForce library by
reinforce.io and Kubernetes.
Neither local GPUs, tensorflow-/tensorforce-, nor Kubernetes
installations are required!


- Create fully customized clusters (including GPU machines) to
be able to run parallelized machine learning tasks.
- Setup your RL experiments using simple json config files.
Tensorforce-client already comes with many pre-defined configs that
can be used out of the box.
- Start your own reinforcement learning experiments on the generated
clusters via simple command lines in your favourite local shell.
- Watch the progress of your experiments by following basic stats
(e.g. average reward per episode) or via occasional tensorboard
downloads.
- Pause, stop, resume, download your experiments all from your
local command line.
- Link clusters to your experiments to shut them down automatically
once the experiment is done running.
- Optional: Use tensorboard (for that, you do need local TensorFlow, though) to
view and debug your RL models and experiments in the browser.


### Requirements

([For Detailled Installation Instructions: See our Docs](http://tensorforce-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

- A google cloud platform account (any google account will do) with
billing enabled and certain "google cloud APIs" activated.
- The Google Cloud SDK.
- Local installation of Python3.5 or higher.
- The tensorforce-client python module (pip-installable).



### Usage and Examples

Checkout the [tensorforce-client documentation](http://tensorforce-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in order to
learn how to run your own reinforcement learning
experiments in the cloud. To get quick help on the command line
for certain commands and subcommands, simply use the `--help` flag
like so:

```
$ python -m tensorforce_client --help
```

Or, more specifically:

```
$ python -m tensorforce_client cluster --help
```

Or:

```
$ python -m tensorforce_client experiment new --help
```


#### Creating a new project

First, create a tensorforce project on your local machine:

```
# Create, then cd into a directory of your choice in which you would
# like to start a new project.

$ python -m tensorforce_client init -r [some remote gcloud project ID e.g. TensorForce-Client]

# This will link your already existing cloud project with the current working dir on your local machine.
# Your project is now initialized.
# - Sample configs are automatically copied into the project's `config` dir.
# - An empty folder `experiments` is created into which new experiments will be placed.
```


#### Creating a cluster in the cloud

Then, start a small cluster in the cloud by using one of the already
provided json cluster config files:

```
$ python -m tensorforce_client cluster create -f small_cluster.json -n my-new-cluster
```

This will bring up a new Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, which may take
a few minutes. When the script terminates, you are all set to start your
first experiment:

#### Creating and starting an experiment

```
$ python -m tensorforce_client experiment new -f simple_a3c -c my-new-cluster -n my-new-experiment --start
```

This creates and right away starts (`--start` option) a new experiment using the
`simple_a3c` specification (which will be discovered automatically from the
`configs/experiments/simple_a3c.json` file). The cluster that we would like this experiment
to run on has already been created in the previous step, but you can also link
a new cluster to the experiment, in which case that cluster would be created upon the experiment's
start. Also, we are specifying a custom name for the experiment (`my-new-experiment`), instead of
using the one given in the json config file.
